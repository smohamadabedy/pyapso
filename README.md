# python_pso
PSO algorithm written in python 
this also work with adaptive weight coffs 
you can customize your own function in fit_func file and also add some constriaint there.
after editing the fit_func file then you should change space_num for example if your function has 3 var write:
space_num = np.array([10,15,8])
this array provide dimention and searching space for program.

fit_func with constraint is now available.
